What a day! The 2017 edition of the NipMuck marathon was full of good stories - we had travelers from Virginia and Minnesota, several folks were running their first marathon, others were racing in their very first trail race, and lots of local trail runners return year after year (after year!). Our aid stations and volunteers are second to none - y'all make this the fantastic race that it is. Thank you to everyone who came out to race, volunteer, and cheer. See you next year for our 35th anniversary!
