The weekend of August 15th Steve L. and a few others are fast hiking the Pemi Loop.

Steve envisions a quick trip, travel up Friday, return Sunday. We will  camp overnight Friday, then get an early start Saturday on Pemi.  This is a 31 mile lollipop route. Much of it is super technical—not very runnable.  Our goal is to fast hike and run what is available. Once done, camp Saturday night, and drive home Sunday.

This is fully self supported. Bring your tent… Your food…</p>
