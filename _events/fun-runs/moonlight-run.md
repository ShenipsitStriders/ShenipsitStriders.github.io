## Description
Join us for a fun run in and around scenic Soapstone Mountain under a full winter moon. The course can vary but is usually mostly along single-track trails and 3-5 mi long. The finish line is atop the fire tower on Soapstone with an ETA of midnight.
The Moonlight Run is not a race. The group typically stays together and no one will be left behind.
Runners should dress appropriately for cold temperatures and bring a headlamp. With clear skies and particularly if thereâ€™s also snow in the ground, however, there should be sufficient natural light to leave them off.
People should feel free to bring a baked good to share and warm beverages for after the run. *Due to DEP regulations, alcohol is not allowed.*
