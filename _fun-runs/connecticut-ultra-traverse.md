## Description

The **Connecticut Ultra Traverse (CUT) 112**Â is a run that covers the length of the state of Connecticut from North to South. 
On June 2-3 at 8:00 AM we will be running the New England Trail from the MA-CT border to the Long Island Sound in Guilford, CT. This is where we will organize our 112 mile run.
Some will run the entire State and some will run shorter distances relay style.  Others will graciously offer support and logistics.  We estimate the total distance to be about 112 miles, so we welcome all the support we can get, at any pace.

This route strings together some of the best trail running in Connecticut including Suffield Mountain, Peak Mountain, Hatchet Hill, Wilcox Park, Penwood State Park (Traprock 50k), Heublein Tower, MDC Reservoirs, Rattlesnake Mountain, Pinnacle Rock, Crescent Lake, Ragged Mountain, Castle Craig, Lamentation Mountain, Chauncey Peak, Mount Higby, Powder Ridge, Tri-Mountain State Park, Bluff Head (Bimblers Bluff 50k) , Cockaponset State Forest, East River Preserve, and the Guilford Point waterfront. These blue blaze trails are all maintained by Connecticut Forest and Parks Association and this run is being done to help raise funds to help support this great organization.

The CUT 112 is not a race. The group typically stays together and no one will be left behind.

Hopefully this will become an event that we can do every year, thank you for being a part of the early days of the CT Ultra Traverse! #CUT112 #NoSleepTillGuilford
