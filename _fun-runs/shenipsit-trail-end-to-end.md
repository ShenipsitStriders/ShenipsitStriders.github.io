## Description
The Shenipsit End-to-End run - our infamous yearly trip down the length of the Shenipsit trail. We welcome all who love trail running to join us, members and non-members alike. Many will run part of the trail, and a few hearty souls will complete the whole distance. This is a group run, not a race, and we will try to stay together or regroup as necessary. We may split into two groups this year.

This year we will be running south to north, starting in East Hampton at the Shenipsit Trails southern trail head and covering the approximately 42miles to Stafford, CT. We expect the entire run to take around 13 hours.

Runners should dress appropriately for cold temperatures, be prepared for fueling and hydration needs during the run, and bring a headlamp for the start and finish.

More detail to come as we finalize the logistics, aid stations and distance options
