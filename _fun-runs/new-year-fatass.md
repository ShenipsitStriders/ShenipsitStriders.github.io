## Description
Ring in the New Year with the traditional Shenipsit Strider fat-ass style event! Once again we'll be meeting at Valley Falls park in Vernon.

Fat ass events are very low key. It's not a race, it's a social extravaganza! The event is held for 6 hours on New Years Day from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM. There will be a ~4km course marked with Strider flags for you to follow. Show up at 8:00 AM or any time after, and run and/or hike for as much or little as you like. The event is entirely self-timed and there will be a sheet for all participants to track their laps.
