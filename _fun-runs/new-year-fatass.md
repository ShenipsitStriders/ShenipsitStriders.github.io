## Description
The Shenipsit Striders' New Year Fatass is a club tradition that just so happens to be the best way to bring in a new year. As we can all agree that we need a new year more than ever, hopefully you'll be able to participate in our socially distanced, remote running, kick-the-old-year-to-the-curb, 2021 edition.

Fatasses are known for their laid back atmosphere. We're taking it up a notch and making the 2021 New Year Fatass chiller than ever before!

Venue: Given that we are going to be socially distanced and remote, this year the venue is anywhere you want it to be. We are **\*not\*** having the customary gathering for obvious health reasons. Instead, for 2021 you can do the run anywhere that you want as long as it is safe to do so. Find a cool trail, or even hop on the treadmill at home. Just get some miles in!

Speaking of miles: the fatass is a run-what-you want event, in a 6 hour window. Run as many or as few miles as you want in that window. Want to do a 20 minute walk that covers a mile? Or do a 50k in 6 hours? Anything goes!

Trail Support: Sadly, no sharing of food or beverage this year üôÅ

Timing: The New Year Fatass has always been self-recorded, and some things are timeless - it's self recorded this year too! When you've completed your New Year run, you'll self-report through a web form (which we will be setting up closer to January 1).
Awards: This year calls for something to cheer us all up. We've got some cool custom-made Strider New Year Fatass stickers made up and will mail them out to all participants who want one. That will be done when you report your run as mentioned above.

Entry fees: Nope

We ask everyone to follow all state health guidelines while out on their run, and we look forward to 2021 being a better year!
