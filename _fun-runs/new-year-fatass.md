## Description
Ring in the New Year with the traditional Shenipsit Strider fat-ass style event! Once again we'll be meeting at Valley Falls park in Vernon.

Fat ass events are very low key. It's not a race, it's a social extravaganza! The event is held for 6 hours on New Years Day from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM. There will be a ~4km course marked with Strider flags for you to follow. Show up at 8:00 AM or any time after, and run and/or hike for as much or little as you like. The event is entirely self-timed and there will be a sheet for all participants to track their laps.

Keeping with the traditional fatass event rules, there is no entry fee. There is also no official support on the course, but we encourage everyone to bring a treat to share.
