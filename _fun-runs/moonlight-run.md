## Description

Join us for the 34th annual Moonlight Run: a fun run and hike in and around scenic Camp Aya Po under a full winter moon. 
This event is co-hosted by the Town of Somers and the Shenipsit Striders.

The gathering and community hike begins at 7:00 PM, consisting of a 1 mile family-friendly hike around Hurds Lake, and hot cocoa and baked goods for all afterwards!

For those who want to join us for the run, the run begins at 8:00 PM and consists of a 2.5 mile route over Perkin's Mountain. (And bonus loop for those who are interested!)

Somers community services personnel will be on-site. 

The Moonlight Run is not a race, it is a family friendly outdoor event. The group stays together and no one will be left behind.

Runners should dress appropriately for cold temperatures and bring a headlamp. However, with clear skies and particularly if thereâ€™s also snow in the ground, there should be sufficient natural light to leave the headlamps off.

People should feel free to bring a baked good to share and warm beverages for after the run. *Due to this being a family event on community property, alcohol is not allowed.*
