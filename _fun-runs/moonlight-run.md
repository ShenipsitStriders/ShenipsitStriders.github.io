## Description

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">We have a change of venue for 2019! The Moonlight Run is taking place at <strong>Camp Aya Po</strong> instead of Soapstone Mountain this year!</div>

Join us for a fun run and hike in and around scenic Camp Aya Po under a full winter moon. 

The gathering and community hike begins at 7:00 PM, consisting of warm beverages and yummy baked goods, and a short family-friendly hike.

For those who want to join us for the run, the run begins at 8:00 PM and consists of a 2.5 mile course.

Somers community services personnel will be on-site. 

The Moonlight Run is not a race, it is a family friendly outdoor event. The group stays together and no one will be left behind.

Runners should dress appropriately for cold temperatures and bring a headlamp. However, with clear skies and particularly if thereâ€™s also snow in the ground, there should be sufficient natural light to leave the headlamps off.

People should feel free to bring a baked good to share and warm beverages for after the run. *Due to DEP regulations, alcohol is not allowed.*
