The **Shenipsit Striders** trail running club was started in 1975 by a small group of friends in northcentral Connecticut that wanted to get together for weekly runs in the woods. Today, the club has grown to include members from all corners of Connecticut and even a few from other states in the New England region.

The Shenipsit Striders is a nonprofit organization. We give back to the trail community so that everyone can enjoy the Connecticut outdoors. Our proceeds support groups like the Joshuaâ€™s Trust, Connecticut Forest and Parks Association and other local land conservation groups.

The club is steered by a Board that holds open meetings at different times throughout the year. The current club officers are:
