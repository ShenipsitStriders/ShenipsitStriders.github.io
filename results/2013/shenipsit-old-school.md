March 30 2013

"Official" results (of an un-official race). Thanks to everey one that came out and gave the course a run. We had just over 30 runners come out (and one dog). I hope you enjoyed my "home" trail as much as I do. The only thing better than having others enjoy and appreciate the trail is that we left a bit better than we found it. A HUGE thanks to my sisters Jen & Jess for manning the Aid Station at Mile 3/9. Especially Jen, who spent her last "free" Saturday before heading off to the Military by helping me and all the runners out. We'll be back next year (hopefully as a Grand tree Race). Constructive criticism is always welcome however, we are a small operation that wants to remain low key and low cost (free). Hope you all had fun! Lots of pics posting shortly. please go through them and tag others. Share and download as you wish, you earned it.
