### 6 km Jerry Stage Sampler
The course has a length of **5.86 km**. The terrain shares some of the features of the 24 km course.

*The courses include a number of steep, rocky, slippery, or otherwise treacherous areas. Though injuries have been few and minor during past races, a serious injury is possible. **Because parts of the long course are relatively inaccessible, it is possible that an injured runner might have to wait an hour or more for emergency medical care.** Please do NOT enter either race if you are not prepared to accept responsibility for yourself and these risks.*

## Awards
Unique trophies go to the top finisher(s) in each age-group division. The number of trophies for each division will be based on the number of pre-entrants in each. A division must have at least two entrants for a trophy to be given.
