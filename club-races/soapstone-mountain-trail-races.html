<hr />
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The courses include a number of steep, rocky, slippery, or otherwise treacherous areas. Though injuries have been few and minor during past races, a serious injury is possible. <strong>Because parts of the long course are relatively inaccessible, it is possible that an injured runner might have to wait an hour or more for emergency medical care.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Please do NOT enter either race if you are not prepared to accept responsibility for yourself and these risks.</em></span></span></p>
