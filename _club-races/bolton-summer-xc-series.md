        Preregistration for the series is preferred. This is a fundraiser for Bolton High School Athletics, so your support goes to further oppertunities for the next generation of athletes! Plus, by preregistering for the series, you effectively get one race 'free'.

        Race-day registration is also available.

        ### Entry Fees

        * Childrens' Race (5 through 13) - $3 per race, or $15 if pre-registered for the series
        * Adult Race - $5 per race, or $25 if pre-registered for the series
        * *By pre-registering for the series, you get 6 races for the price of 5*

        ## Weather Policy

        We will run through all weather **except for lightening**. Should a thunderstorm begin during a race, we will delay if possible, cancel if necessary. We will **NOT** cancel for predicted thunderstorms since the predictions are often wrong. Most likely, if you show up, we will be there to time you!\\
        *There will be no refunds due to weather.*
