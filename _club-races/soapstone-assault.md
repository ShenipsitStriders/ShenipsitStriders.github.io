The Shenipsit Striders have decided to change this year's Soapstone Assault into
 a virtual challenge. Unfortunately it would be impossible to run the event as 
normal while keeping a safe distance among participants, volunteers, and other 
users of the venue. We are providing a 9-day window to complete the event and we
 are adding a six-hour challenge for those that just can't get enough Soapstone 
from the classic course. Read on for details!
{: .alert .alert-info}

## Race Information
There are two options for this race. Both races are to be completed in full compliance of Connecticut COVID19 rules.

**Soapstone Assault:** Runners will complete the “classic” 5.5 mile course with 1500’ climbing. The “finish line” is at the base of the tower after the final climb up Killer Hill (powerline trail).

**SoapstoneSix:** Runners will choose a 6 hour block and will run as many loops of the Assault course as they can complete in the time allotment. Runners should not pause their watch until the completion of the 6 hours. To complete the loop back to the start, after reaching the top of the 6th summit (Killer Hill), runners will continue towards the tower, go left following the trail along the fenced radio tower, and continue down the paved road to the starting point. This adds about a mile to the Assault course loop. Runners will pass their cars for refueling on every lap.

## Course
The course is at [Soapstone Mountain](http://www.ct.gov/deep/shenipsit){: target="_blank"} and has a length of **5.5 mi** with 6 ascents of Soapstone Mountain. A map of the full route can be found here: [Assault Course](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/connecticut/soapstone-mountain-assault-course?u=i){: target="_blank"}

A video of the route and further route details will be posted to our Facebook group: [https://www.facebook.com/ShenipsitStridersEvents/](https://www.facebook.com/ShenipsitStridersEvents/){: target="_blank"}

The “start line” is the trail head sign, just before the blue-blazed trail entrance. Runners circumnavigate the base of Soapstone Mountain in a counterclockwise direction and each time they encounter a trail heading upwards they take it to the peak. Once at the top, they take the same trail back down to resume the circuit around the base of the mountain. This up-and-down sequence is repeated for the first 5 different trails that runners come across. The 6th trail to be encountered is the infamous &#8220;Killer Hill&#8221;, which runners also have to climb, and finish at the base of the tower.

The race course includes a number of steep, rocky, slippery, or otherwise treacherous areas. Though injuries have been few and minor during past races, a serious injury is possible. **Because parts of the course are relatively inaccessible, it is possible that an injured runner might have to wait an hour or more for emergency medical care.** *Please do NOT enter this race if you are not prepared to accept responsibility for yourself and these risks.*

## Results and Awards
All finishers will receive a unique medal from Ragged Cuts for conquering the beast. Four finishers will be chosen at random to receive a $20 gift card to Sound Runner.

Runners will self-report their race results by simply pressing the “record results“ on the Ultrasignup page. You will be asked to provide GPS proof of your run with a link to Strava or a GPX file for verification.

**Soapstone Assault:** We will award the top three overall winners in men’s and women’s categories by finish time.

**SoapstoneSix:** Each summit of the mountain will earn one point for the runner. Winner will be the runner with the most points at the end of 6 hours. In case of a points tie, the runner who was fastest to the point total will win. We will award the top three overall points winners in men’s and women’s categories.
