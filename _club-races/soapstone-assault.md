## Course
The course is at [Soapstone Mountain](http://www.ct.gov/deep/shenipsit){: target="_blank"} and has a length of **5.5 mi** with 6 ascents of Soapstone Mountain. A map of the full route can be found here: [Assault Course](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/connecticut/soapstone-mountain-assault-course?u=i){: target="_blank"}

A video of the route and further route details will be posted to our Facebook group: [https://www.facebook.com/ShenipsitStridersEvents/](https://www.facebook.com/ShenipsitStridersEvents/){: target="_blank"}

The “start line” is the trail head sign, just before the blue-blazed trail entrance. Runners circumnavigate the base of Soapstone Mountain in a counterclockwise direction and each time they encounter a trail heading upwards they take it to the peak. Once at the top, they take the same trail back down to resume the circuit around the base of the mountain. This up-and-down sequence is repeated for the first 5 different trails that runners come across. The 6th trail to be encountered is the infamous &#8220;Killer Hill&#8221;, which runners also have to climb, and finish at the base of the tower.

The race course includes a number of steep, rocky, slippery, or otherwise treacherous areas. Though injuries have been few and minor during past races, a serious injury is possible. **Because parts of the course are relatively inaccessible, it is possible that an injured runner might have to wait an hour or more for emergency medical care.** *Please do NOT enter this race if you are not prepared to accept responsibility for yourself and these risks.*
