## Course
The race is an **out-and-back** covering a distance of **14.5 mi**.

The [course](http://shenipsitstriders.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nipmuck_south_course.pdf){: target="_blank"} has some interesting trail variations over beautiful terrain, with several small bridge crossings, a climb to a 50 ft cliff, fields, and woods. The race starts at Mansfield Hollow State Park and winds its way to Old Turnpike Road (off Route 44). There are three road crossings that will be staffed by volunteers from the Mansfield Fire Department.

## Aid Stations
There will be **3 aid stations** along the course at **miles 3.5, 7 (turnaround), and 10.5** (stations 1 and 3 are the same but encountered both during outbound and inbound runs). Each station will have water and energy snacks such as fruits and pretzels.

*The race course includes a number of steep, rocky, slippery, or otherwise treacherous areas. Though injuries have been few and minor during past races, a serious injury is possible. **Because parts of the course are relatively inaccessible, it is possible that an injured runner might have to wait an hour or more for emergency medical care.** Please do NOT enter this race if you are not prepared to accept responsibility for yourself and these risks.*

## Awards
Recognition will be given for overall female and male winners as well as division winners.

## Miscellaneous Information
Food and beverages will be provided as a courtesy to runners after the race.

The start has two outdoor bathroom facilities which are new and clean. There are picnic tables and a hand water pump. Parking is available without charge very close to the start of the race.
