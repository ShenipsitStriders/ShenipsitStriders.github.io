## Course
The race is an **out-and-back** covering a distance of **14.5 mi**.

The [course](http://shenipsitstriders.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nipmuck_south_course.pdf){: target="_blank"} has some interesting trail variations over beautiful terrain, with several small bridge crossings, a climb to a 50 ft cliff, fields, and woods. The race starts at Mansfield Hollow State Park and winds its way to Old Turnpike Road (off Route 44). There are three road crossings that runners must be cautious of while crossing.

## Covid-19 Update
### Virtual Options
Anyone who would prefer to race "virtually" on the actual race course will have that choice at registration. You will have from June 5 to June 20 to run the race course on your own and report your time at Ultrasignup. The course GPX and Alltrails map will be released soon and we highly encourage everyone to do some practice runs on course using the map. Our virtual racers will receive the race swag and be listed in the virtual event results.

### In Person Option with COVID changes
We are opening registration but will not collect fees until we have reviewed the spring state COVID guidelines. We expect to have more information in March and will update the COVID changes needed at that point. THERE WILL BE NO DAY OF REGISTRATION. It is expected that we WILL have to cap the number of entrants (we expect to be able to let in ~50) and will need staggered start times. We will use a First Come First Served method to determine who gets into the in-person race. Anyone on the waitlist after we have capped the registrant numbers will be given an option to convert to a virtual event.

## Benefactors
Proceeds will go to trail stewardship organizations in Connecticut, such as the [Connecticut Forest and Park Association](https://www.ctwoodlands.org/){: target="_blank"}, [Joshuaâ€™s Trust](https://joshuastrust.org/){: target="_blank"}, and [Northern Connecticut Land Trust](https://northernctlandtrust.org/){: target="_blank"}.
