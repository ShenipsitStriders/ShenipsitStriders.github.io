## Courses
Both courses cover varying quality dirt roads, unused logging roads, narrow footpaths and a rocky streambed.

### 24 km Race
The course has a length of **24 km**.

#### Aid Stations
There will be **3 or more aid stations** along the course with at least water.

#### Cutoffs
Runners should reach

* Aid Station 2 (approximately the 8 mile mark) in a time **≤ 2.5 hs**, AND
* Aid Station 3 (approximately the 12.5 mile mark) in a time **≤ 3.5 hs**.


### 6 km Jerry Stage Sampler
The course has a length of **5.86 km**. The terrain shares some of the features of the 24 km course.

*The courses include a number of steep, rocky, slippery, or otherwise treacherous areas. Though injuries have been few and minor during past races, a serious injury is possible. **Because parts of the long course are relatively inaccessible, it is possible that an injured runner might have to wait an hour or more for emergency medical care.** Please do NOT enter either race if you are not prepared to accept responsibility for yourself and these risks.*

## Awards
Unique trophies go to the top finisher(s) in each age-group division. The number of trophies for each division will be based on the number of pre-entrants in each. A division must have at least two entrants for a trophy to be given.

## Miscellaneous Information
Both races feature computerized timing and results. A delicious vegetarian picnic will follow (a donation of $5 is welcome from those not racing).

Distinctive *organic cotton* T-shirts are available for $20. Guarantee yours by pre-registering. A limited number will be available for day-of-race registrants.

Free camping is available in the RRRC campground Saturday night for those pre-registered (please email the RD). There are no changing or shower facilities.
