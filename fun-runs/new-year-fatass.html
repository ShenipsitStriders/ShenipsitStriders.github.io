<h2>Date</h2>
<time datetime="2018-01-01T08:00-05:00">Monday, January 1 2018, at 8:00 AM</time>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Valley+Falls+Park,+300+Valley+Falls+Rd,+Vernon,+CT+06066/@41.8132556,-72.478309,13z" target="_blank">Valley Falls Park</a> in Vernon, CT</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ring in the New Year with the traditional Shenipsit Strider fat-ass style event! Once again we'll be meeting at Valley Falls park in Vernon.</p>
<p>Fat ass events are very low key. It's not a race, it's a social extravaganza! The event is held for 6 hours on New Years Day from <time datetime="2018-01-01T08:00-05:00">8:00 AM</time> to <time datetime="2018-01-01T14:00-05:00">2:00 PM</time>. There will be a ~4k mile course marked with Strider flags for you to follow. Show up at <time datetime="2018-01-01T08:00-05:00">8:00 AM</time> or any time after, and run and/or hike for as much or little as you like. The event is entirely self-timed and there will be a sheet for all participants to track their laps.</p>
<p>Keeping with the traditional fatass event rules, there is no entry fee. There is also no official support on the course, but we encourage everyone to bring a treat to share.</p>
