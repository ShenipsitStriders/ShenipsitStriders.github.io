# {{ page.title }}

We are a group of people ranging from walkers and hikers to speedsters and ultra-runners.

We all love the woods and mountains. Above all we love to move and connect with nature.

We compete mainly in trail races, from short to very long, mostly in New England but also far away. We also participate in snowshoe races and are starting to delve deeper into winter sports.
