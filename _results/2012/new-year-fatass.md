Everyone's out of the woods, I'm home, showered and enjoying a big bowl of soup.  mmmm..

You couldn't have asked for nicer weather for a group long run (well, you could ask, but you wouldn't get it - this is January after all).

27 folks came out to start the New Year off with some trail running - ages ranged from 10 to 68 running from 1-10 laps and everything in between.  All appeared to have had a good time (they were smiling when I saw them at least).

Course was a nominal 5k trail loop at Crandalls Park in Tolland, CT with one good hill accounting for about 300' of climb per loop.  Results are based upon my best attempt at deciphering the lap sheets where each runner recorded their time.  If I've gotten any wrong, let me know and I'll correct it.
